# Happiness Dataset (2017)

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the World Happiness Report 2017 dataset. The objective is to explore the factors influencing happiness scores across countries using structured exploratory data analysis (EDA) and meaningful visualizations.

This repository demonstrates practical skills in:
Data cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data visualization using multiple plot types

## Data Cleaning  
The dataset was cleaned before analysis to ensure accuracy and consistency:
Handled missing and null values
Renamed columns for better readability
Verified and corrected data types
Checked for inconsistencies and outliers

Clean data ensures reliable analysis and prevents misleading visual interpretations.

## Visualizations Performed  

The following visualizations were created to analyze different dimensions of the dataset:

**Line Plot**  
  Used to observe trends and variations in happiness scores across countries or rankings.

**Bar Plot**  
  Used for comparing happiness scores or contributing factors across selected countries.

**Heatmap**  
  Shows correlations between numerical features such as GDP, health, freedom, trust, generosity, and happiness score.

**Scatter Plot**  
  Explores relationships between variables such as GDP per capita and happiness score.

**Histogram**  
  Displays the distribution of happiness scores and other numerical attributes.

**Swarm Plot**  
  Visualizes individual data points while comparing distributions across categories.

**Box Plot**  
  Identifies medians, variability, and outliers in happiness scores and related factors.

Each visualization was chosen to support analytical interpretation rather than decoration.
